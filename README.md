## ðŸ“Œ Repositories

Watch this space! Iâ€™m currently creating projects in the following areas:
- End-to-end AI applications and RAG pipelines
- Understanding and implementing AI guardrails and safety systems
- Exploring post-training strategies and terminology
- Working with diffusion models and generative AI architectures
- Getting started with LangChain and building intuitive AI agents
- Creating dummy use cases across various domains like:
  - Airline (e.g., predictive maintenance, intelligent customer support)
  - Energy (e.g., anomaly detection, real-time grid analytics)
  - Business Assurance (e.g., revenue assurance using audit platforms)
  - Dairy Industry (e.g., milk quality prediction, supply chain AI)

These projects will cover core concepts in data platforms, AI integration, and scalable data engineering.
